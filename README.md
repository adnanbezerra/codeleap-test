##  :clipboard: Description

That's my resolution of CodeLeap's front-end developer test. It's a simple React application with some nice features, such as Redux, custom hooks and other. 

It has, basically, four main screens, and is completely focused on the user experience. We were specifically requested to not focus on creating beautiful code, but to translate Figma into beautiful UX.

## üèÅ Running the project

This project was made using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and thus, to run it, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)'s most recent version installed on your computer.

First of all, navigate towards the repository and run the following command to install all of the project's dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Next, you must configure the `.env` file, which requires the atribute `VITE_BASE_URL` so that this project can connect to the back-end of the application. 

Once it's done, you can start the project by running:

```
npm run dev
```
